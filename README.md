This is not my work. This is the food app found in the "The Complete React Native + Hooks" Course by Stephen Grider. But there's some differences though:
1) I use the latest version of react native therefore I use the Pressable API in place of TouchableOpacity
2) I use Typescript
3) I use react navigation v6 with hooks and types consideration

If you're following this course but you want to use the latest versions and typescript intead, you can refer to this repository
Feel free to fork and to use my work whatever it pleases you
